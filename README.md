# Dice-Roll-Game
This is a multi-player game built using Python language.
The players are prompted to input their number, that is, how many players would be playing the game.
Now each player has the option to either roll a dice or skip.
With each dice rolled, the player's score increases, but if the score displayed after the dice is rolled is 1, the player loses all their accumulated points.
The targeted score is 30. The player to reach this score first wins the game.

HAVE FUN!!!
